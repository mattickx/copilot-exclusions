# CoPilot Business content exclusion

CoPilot Business is a powerful tool, but it's important to be aware of certain situations where its application may not be suitable.

This repository provides a curated "content exclusion list" for CoPilot Business.
Aimed as a first line of defense to prevent the inadvertent leakage of keys, secrets, or other sensitive information.

## Usage

A guide on how to configure a content exclusion list can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot-business/configuring-content-exclusions-for-github-copilot)

Feel free to leverage, copy, fork, modify and share this exclusion list without any restrictions within your organization.
